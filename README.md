# Psychic Reader, for Google Assistant

Psychic Reader is an app for Actions on Google that can be invoked on any Google Assistant device (phones, Google Home, Allo, etc.) by saying "Talk to Psychic Reader". This is the backend and most of the frontend (the text editor frontend is [here](https://github.com/karan1149/psychic-google-assistant-editor)).

The user of the app can tell their friends to ask Psychic Reader any question, and the app will always respond with the correct answer. Secretly, the user will be using a separate connected device to provide answers for Psychic Reader. The connected device will appear to be using an innocent text editor, not typing anything suspicious. 

For example, a friend could ask, "How old am I?", and the user of the text editor types in a secret command (".20 years old." in this case), and the Psychic Reader will respond with "20 years old".

As this is happening, the editor appears to be typing out something else:
